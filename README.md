Instructions for installations: The user would need to first download all of the files and then build it for their given android device within the Unity editor. Once Built, they would be able to run the game on their device.

Instructions for use: The user is first brought into the starting scene in which the user would need to click on the start button.  Once that is completed, the user is brought into the actual game scene in which the game would show the user a sequence that the user would need to press using their google cardboard trigger.  If the user selects the sequence correctly, they are brought out of the game area to a congratulations screen.  If the user does not select the sequence correctly, the user would be given a buzzing sound indicating that they did not select the orbs in the correct sequence.
